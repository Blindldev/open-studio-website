                    <p><strong>Candle making is the FINAL step in the ceramic process.</strong> You must:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create your ceramic piece on the wheel or through handbuilding</li>
                        <li>Let it dry completely</li>
                        <li>Bisque fire the piece</li>
                        <li>Glaze your piece</li>
                        <li>Final fire your glazed piece</li>
                        <li><strong>THEN</strong> you can make it into a candle using the wax melter</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Sample shapes are available in the studio</strong> - check them out to see examples of good candle vessel shapes before you create your own piece!</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-hand-holding-heart"></i> Personal Use</h3>
                    <p>The candle making equipment is primarily intended for <strong>personal use</strong>. If you're making candles for yourself, friends, or family, you're welcome to use the studio's wax and supplies at no additional cost!</p>

                    <p>If you plan to sell candles and make a large quantity, that's absolutely fine! However, we ask that you <strong>bring your own wax</strong> for commercial production. This helps us keep supplies available for everyone.</p>

                        <li><strong>Warm-up Time:</strong> The wax melter needs to run for approximately <strong>20 minutes</strong> before it's ready to pour. Please be patient and wait for it to reach the proper temperature.</li>
                        <li><strong>When You're Done:</strong> Always <strong>turn off and unplug</strong> the wax melter when you're finished. Safety first!</li>
                        <li><strong>Clean Up:</strong> Please clean up any spilled wax and return all supplies to their designated areas.</li>

                                <p>Select your <strong>fully fired and glazed</strong> ceramic piece. Make sure it's clean, dry, and completely finished. The piece should be watertight and ready for wax.</p>

                                <p>Choose an appropriately sized wick for your vessel. The wick should be tall enough to extend above the wax once poured, plus about 1 inch extra. For wider vessels (over 3 inches), you may need multiple wicks.</p>

                                <p>Use a wick sticker or hot glue to secure the wick to the bottom center of your ceramic vessel. Keep it straight using a wick holder or by tying it to a pencil across the top of the vessel.</p>

                                <p>Turn on the wax melter and allow it to warm up for approximately <strong>20 minutes</strong>. This ensures the wax will melt evenly and reach the proper pouring temperature. Be patient - this step is crucial!</p>

                                <h4>Measure and Melt Your Wax</h4>
                                <p>Measure the wax you need (account for shrinkage - you'll need slightly more than your vessel's volume). For personal use, use the studio wax. If making candles to sell, use your own wax. Add it to the melter and wait until it's fully melted and reaches around 185¬∞F.</p>

                                <p>Once the wax is melted, add your chosen fragrance oil (typically 6-10% of wax weight). Stir gently for about 2 minutes, then let cool slightly to 135-145¬∞F before pouring. This temperature helps reduce air bubbles.</p>

                                <p>Allow the candle to cool and set completely (this can take several hours, depending on size). As it cools, you may notice a slight depression around the wick - this is normal due to wax shrinkage!</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Pro Tips</h3>
                    <ul class="tips-list">
                        <li><strong>Start with samples:</strong> Check out the sample shapes in the studio before creating your candle vessel to see what shapes work best</li>
                        <li><strong>Finish first:</strong> Never attempt to make a candle until your piece is fully fired and glazed</li>
                        <li><strong>Test water tightness:</strong> Before making a candle, test your ceramic piece to ensure it holds water without leaking</li>
                        <li><strong>Wick sizing:</strong> Wider vessels (over 3 inches) may need multiple wicks for even burning - place them about 2-3 inches apart</li>
                        <li><strong>Curing time:</strong> Let candles cure for 24-48 hours before lighting for best results and longer burn time</li>
                        <li><strong>First burn:</strong> Burn candles for at least 2-3 hours on first use to create a full melt pool across the entire surface</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Never leave burning candles unattended and keep away from flammable materials</li>
