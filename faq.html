                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What materials are provided?</h3>
                    <p>Members receive 25 pounds of clay per month. Additional clay is not currently available for purchase as we explore how the studio handles the additional 400 pounds of clay per month (kilns can only take so much). If clay does become available to purchase in the future, it will be at $3/pound to ensure the additional cost of glazing and firing is covered for this clay.</p>

                    <h3>How often do you fire the kilns?</h3>
                    <p>We typically fire the kilns every two weeks. Check our firing updates page for the schedule.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I bring my own clay?</h3>
                    <p>No, we only allow the use of studio-provided clay to ensure compatibility with our kilns and glazes. This also ensures resources are used efficiently and fairly.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How does the firing process work?</h3>
                <p>All pieces must be bisque fired in the open studio space before they can be glazed. Glazing will take place in the main studio where the main glazed pieces kiln is located. Important notes about firing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each member is responsible for tracking how long ago they made each piece</li>
                    <li>Pieces must dry for AT LEAST 14 days before bisque firing (ideally 18 days for thicker pieces)</li>
                    <li>Initial all pieces and add notes or take pictures to track when they were made</li>
                    <li>If a piece explodes during bisque firing, that is the member's responsibility</li>
                    <li>Any questions about the firing process should be directed to Mike</li>
                </ul>
