                <h3>How does the firing process work?</h3>
                <p>All pieces must be bisque fired in the open studio space before they can be glazed. Glazing will take place in the main studio where the main glazed pieces kiln is located. Important notes about firing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each member is responsible for tracking how long ago they made each piece</li>
                    <li>Pieces must dry for AT LEAST 10 days before bisque firing (ideally 14 days for thicker pieces)</li>
                    <li>Initial all pieces and add notes or take pictures to track when they were made</li>
                    <li>If a piece explodes during bisque firing, that is the member's responsibility</li>
                    <li>Any questions about the firing process should be directed to Mike</li>
                </ul>
