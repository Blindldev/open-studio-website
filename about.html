                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>In 2024, I (Mike), was hosting popup pottery social events across the city while creating my own work in my garage. That September, I found a commercial lease with plans to simply keep my kiln for these social gatherings. But things took an exciting turn in October 2024 when I hosted my first social event in that very space.</p>
                
                <p>While this space has flourished and I've had the privilege of teaching over 1000 new students, I found myself missing the intimate atmosphere of my "Garage Studio" - that special place where I could lose myself in the rhythm of pottery-making, accompanied by my favorite music for hours on end.</p>
                
                <p>This longing and feedback from students inspired the creation of Throw247. I wanted to offer a dedicated group of passionate creatives their own mini community - a 24-hour space where they could throw pottery whenever inspiration struck. The vision was clear: a cozy, welcoming environment filled with fun plants, personal tools, and thoughtful touches like a record player to set the perfect vibe.</p>
                
                <p>To maintain the intimate atmosphere, the space will begin with just 15 paying members, plus a few select friends and staff. I'm incredibly excited to see how this space evolves and grows! I look forward to taking feedback too and adapting the space to the needs of the community.</p>

                <h2>What Can 25 Pounds Make?</h2>
                <p>Curious about how much you can create with your monthly clay allowance? Here's what Maggie was able to make during her trial run of the open studio space with just 25 pounds of clay! For scale this is about 70% of the 3 foot shelf space.</p>
